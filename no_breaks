## Partridge Ipsum - (lorem ipsum inspired by the words of Alan Partridge)

... and that was Big Yellow Taxi by Joni Mitchell, a song in which Joni complains that they paved paradise to put up a parking lot. A measure which actually would have alleviated traffic congestion on the outskirts of paradise, something which Joni singularly fails to point out - perhaps because it doesn’t quite fit in with her blinkered view of the world. Nevertheless, nice song.

Oooh scary Irish men. Would you like to recruit me? I like your berets. They're worn by Saddam Hussain, Frank Spencer, the French.

I know lying is wrong, but if the elephant man came in now in a blouse with some make up on, and said "how do I look?" Would you say — bearing in mind he's depressed and has respiratory problems — would you say "go and take that blusher off you mis-shapen headed elephant tranny"? No. You'd say "You look nice... John"
